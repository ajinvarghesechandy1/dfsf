    <h1>One Man's Dream</h1>
    <p>
        Mangalam Group of Publications and Educational Institutions is the
        brainchild of Late Sri. M. C. Varghese (1933–2006), Mangalappallil,
        Kottayam, who was a visionary leader and adventurous entrepreneur. From
        its humble beginning in 1969, Sri. Varghese raised the flagship company
        of the group, Mangalam Publications India Ltd., to one of the leading
        publishing houses in India. Today the Mangalam Group publishes the
        Mangalam daily newspaper, several weekly magazines and an online
        newspaper. Mangalam TV and Radio Mangalam, both begun recently, are also
        slowly ascending the popularity graph.

    <h1>EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS</h1>
    <p>
        An enthusiastic entrepreneur, Sri. M. C. Varghese diversified into the
        educational realm in 1985. He acquired a 30+ acre lush green campus at
        Mangalam Hills, Vettimukal, Ettumanoor and launched a prestigious
        English Medium Residential School there under the banner of Mangalam
        Educational Society. In 1995, he founded Mangalam College of Education
        (B.Ed/M.Ed) in the same campus. With the founding of Mangalam College of
        Engineering (B.Tech/M.Tech) and Mangalam Institute of Management (MBA)
        in 2002, Mangalam Group became a by–word for “quality education near at
        hand”. The CBSE School, M. C. Varghese College of Arts & Science and
        Mangalam School of Architecture and Planning (MASAP) begun in subsequent
        years became permanent memorials for Sri. M. C. Varghese who passed away
        on 9th January 2006. After his demise, his family has taken over the
        baton. Currently his youngest son Sri. Biju Varghese is propelling the
        institutions ahead as Secretary of the Mangalam Educational Society and
        Chairman of the Mangalam Group of Educational Institutions. The
        Management Councils of different Mangalam Institutions consist of
        eminent educationists and experts in Management.
